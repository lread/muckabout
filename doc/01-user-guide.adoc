== Introduction
Clj-http-lite is a Clojure, Babashka and GraalVM compatible liteweight subset of http://github.com/dakrone/clj-http[clj-http].

=== Differences from clj-http

* Instead of Apache HttpClient, clj-http-lite uses HttpURLConnection
* No automatic JSON decoding for response bodies
* No automatic request body encoding beyond charset and url encoding of form params
* No cookie support
* No multipart form uploads
* No persistent connection support
* Fewer options
* namespace rename `clj-http.*` -> `clj-http.lite.*`

Like its namesake, clj-http-lite is light and simple, but ping us if there is some clj-http feature you’d like to see in clj-http-lite.
We can discuss.

=== Supported Environments [[supported-envs]]

* JDK 8, 11, 17
* Clojure 1.8 runtime and above
* Babashka current release
* Windows, Linux, macOS

=== History

* Sep 2011 - https://github.com/dakrone/clj-http[dakrone/clj-http] created (and is still actively maintained)
* Feb 2012 - https://github.com/hiredman/clj-http-lite[hiredman/clj-http-lite] (now archived) forked from `dakrone/clj-http` to use Java’s HttpURLConnection instead of Apache HttpClient.
* Jul 2018 - `martinklepsch/clj-http-lite` forked from `hiredman/clj-http-lite` for new development and maintenance
* Nov 2021 - Martin transfered his fork to `clj-commons/clj-http-lite` so it could get the ongoing love it needs from the Clojure community

=== Interesting Alternatives

Maybe clj-http-lite is not your cup of tea? Some alternatives to explore:

Clojure based:

* http://github.com/dakrone/clj-http[clj-http] - heavier than clj-http-lite, but has many more features

Babashka compatible:

* https://github.com/schmee/java-http-clj[java-http-clj] - Clojure wrapper for java.net.http with async, HTTP/2 and WebSockets
* https://github.com/http-kit/http-kit[http-kit] - minimalist, event-driven, high-performance Clojure HTTP server/client library with WebSocket and asynchronous support
* https://github.com/gnarroway/hato[hato] - An HTTP client for Clojure, wrapping JDK 11's HttpClient
* https://github.com/babashka/babashka.curl[babashka.curl] - A tiny curl wrapper via idiomatic Clojure, inspired by clj-http, Ring and friends

----

== Usage

=== General
HTTP client functionality is provided by the `clj-http.lite.client` namespace:

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[clj-http.lite.client :as client])
----

The client supports simple `get`, `head`, `put`, `post`, and `delete` requests.
They all return Ring-style response maps:

[source,clojure]
----
(client/get "https://google.com")
=> {:status 200
    :headers {"date" "Wed, 17 Aug 2022 21:37:58 GMT"
              "cache-control" "private, max-age=0"
              "content-type" "text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1"
              ...}
    :body "<!doctype html>..."}
----

TIP: We encourage you to try out these examples in your REPL, `httpbin.org` is a free HTTP test playground and used in many of our examples.

[source,clojure]
----
(client/get "https://httpbin.org/user-agent")

;; Tell the server you'd like a json response
(client/get "https://httpbin.org/user-agent" {:accept :json})

;; Or maybe you'd like html back
(client/get "https://httpbin.org/html" {:accept "text/html"})

;; Various options
(client/post "https://httpbin.org/anything"
  {:basic-auth ["joe" "cool"]
   :body "{\"json\": \"input\"}"
   :headers {"X-Api-Version" "2"}
   :content-type :json
   :socket-timeout 1000
   :conn-timeout 1000
   :accept :json})

;; Need to contact a server with an untrusted SSL cert?
(client/get "https://expired.badssl.com" {:insecure? true})

;; By default we automatically follow 30* redirects...
(client/get "https://httpbin.org/redirect-to?url=https%3A%2F%2Fclojure.org")

;; ... but you don't have to
(client/get "https://httpbin.org/redirect-to?url=https%3A%2F%2Fclojure.org"
            {:follow-redirects false})

;; Send form params as a urlencoded body
(client/post "https://httpbin.org/post" {:form-params {:foo "bar"}})

;; Basic authentication
(client/get "https://joe:cool@httpbin.org/basic-auth/joe/cool")
(client/get "https://httpbin.org/basic-auth/joe/cool" {:basic-auth ["joe" "cool"]})
(client/get "https://httpbin.org/basic-auth/joe/cool" {:basic-auth "joe:cool"})

;; Query parameters can be specified as a map
(client/get "https://httpbin.org/get" {:query-params {"q" "foo, bar"}})
----

The client transparently accepts and decompresses the `gzip` and `deflate` content encodings.

[source,clojure]
----
(client/get "https://httpbin.org/gzip")

(client/get "https://httpbin.org/deflate")
----

=== Nested params

Nested parameter `{:a {:b 1}}` in `:form-params` or `:query-params` is automatically flattened to `a[b]=1`.

[source,clojure]
----
(-> (client/get "https://httpbin.org/get"
                {:query-params {:one {:two 2 :three 3}}})
    :body
    println)
{
  "args": {
    "one[three]": "3",
    "one[two]": "2"
  },
  ...
}

(-> (client/post "https://httpbin.org/post"
                 {:form-params {:one {:two 2
                                      :three {:four {:five 5}}}
                                :six 6}})
    :body
    println)
{
  ...
  "form": {
    "one[three][four][five]": "5",
    "one[two]": "2",
    "six": "6"
  },
  ...
}
----

=== Request body coercion

[source,clojure]
----
;; body as byte-array
(client/post "https://httbin.org/post" {:body (.getBytes "testing123")})

;; body from a string
(client/post "https://httpbin.org/post" {:body "testing456"})

;; string :body-encoding is optional and defaults to "UTF-8"
(client/post "https://httpbin.org/post"
             {:body "mystring" :body-encoding "UTF-8"})

;; body from a file
(require '[clojure.java.io :as io])
(spit "clj-http-lite-test.txt" "from a file")
(client/post "https://httpbin.org/post"
             {:body (io/file "clj-http-lite-test.txt")
              :body-encoding "UTF-8"})

;; from a stream
(with-open [is (io/input-stream "clj-http-lite-test.txt")]
  (client/post "https://httpbin.org/post"
               {:body (io/input-stream "clj-http-lite-test.txt")})  )
----

=== Output body coercion

[source,clojure]
----
;; The default response body is a string body
(client/get "https://clojure.org")

;; Coerce to a byte-array
(client/get "http://clojure.org" {:as :byte-array})

;; Coerce to a string with using a specific charset, default is UTF-8
(client/get "http://clojure.org" {:as "US-ASCII"})

;; Try to automatically coerce the body based on the content-type
;; response header charset
(client/get "https://google.com" {:as :auto})

;; Return the body as a stream
;; Note that the connection to the server will NOT be closed until the
;; stream has been read
(let [res (client/get "https://clojure.org" {:as :stream})]
  (with-open [body-stream (:body res)]
    (slurp body-stream)))
----

A more general `request` function is also available, which is useful as a primitive for building higher-level interfaces:

[source,clojure]
----
(defn api-action [method path & [opts]]
  (client/request
    (merge {:method method :url (str "https://some.api/" path)} opts)))
----

=== Exceptions

When a server returns an exceptional HTTP status code, by default, clj-http-lite throws an `ex-info` exception.
The response is included as `ex-data`.

[source,clojure]
----
(client/get "https://httpbin.org/404")
;; => ExceptionInfo clj-http: status 404  clojure.core/ex-info (core.clj:4617)

(-> *e ex-data :status)
;; => 404

(-> *e ex-data keys)
;; => (:headers :status :body)
----

You can suppress HTTP status exceptions and handle them yourself via the `:throw-exceptions` option:

[source,clojure]
----
(client/get "https://httpbin.org/404" {:throw-exceptions false})
----

You can choose to ignore an unknown host via `:ingore-unknown-host?` option.
When enabled, requests return `nil` if the host is not found.

[source,clojure]
----
(client/get "http://aoeuntahuf89o.com" {:ignore-unknown-host? true})
;; => nil
----

=== Proxies

A proxy can be specified by setting the Java properties: `<scheme>.proxyHost` and `<scheme>.proxyPort` where `<scheme>` is the client scheme used (normally `http' or `https').

== Mocking clj-http-lite responses

Mocking responses from the clj-http-lite client in tests is easily accomplished with e.g. `with-redefs`:

[source,clojure]
----
(defn my-http-function []
  (let [response (client/get "https://example.org")]
    (when (= 200 (:status response))
      (:body response))))

(deftest my-http-function-test
  (with-redefs [client/get (fn [_] {:status 200 :headers {"content-type" "text/plain"} :body "OK"})]
    (is (= (my-http-function) "OK"))))
----

More advanced mocking may be performed by matching attributes in the `request`, like the `mock-response` function below.

[source,clojure]
----
(ns http-test
  (:require [clojure.data.json :as json]
            [clojure.test :refer [deftest is testing]]
            [clj-http.lite.client :as client]))

(defn send-report [data]
  (:body (client/post "https://example.com/reports" {:body data})))

(defn get-users []
  (json/read-str (:body (client/get "https://example.com/users"))))

(defn get-admin []
  (let [response (client/get "https://example.com/admin")]
    (if (= 200 (:status response))
      (:body response)
      "403 Forbidden")))

(defn mock-response [{:keys [url method body] :as request}]
  (condp = [url method]
    ["https://example.com/reports" :post]
    {:status  201 :headers {"content-type" "text/plain"} :body (str "created: " body)}

    ["https://example.com/users" :get]
    {:status 200 :headers {"content-type" "application/json"} :body (json/write-str ["joe" "jane" "bob"])}

    ["https://example.com/admin" :get]
    {:status 403 :headers {"content-type" "text/plain"} :body "forbidden"}

    (throw (ex-info "unexpected request" request))))

(deftest send-report-test
  (with-redefs [client/request mock-response]
    (testing "sending report"
      (is (= (send-report {:balance 100}) "created: {:balance 100}")))
    (testing "list users"
      (is (= (get-users) ["joe" "jane" "bob"])))
    (testing "access admin page"
      (is (= (get-admin) "403 Forbidden")))))

== GraalVM Native Image Tips

You’ll need to enable url protocols when building your native image.

See https://www.graalvm.org/22.2/reference-manual/native-image/dynamic-features/URLProtocols/[GraalVM docs].

== Design

The design of `clj-http` (and therefore `clj-http-lite`) is inspired by the https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring[Ring] protocol for Clojure HTTP server applications.

The client in `clj-http.lite.core` makes HTTP requests according to a given Ring request map and returns Ring response maps corresponding to the resulting HTTP response.
The function `clj-http.lite.client/request` uses Ring-style middleware to layer functionality over the core HTTP request/response implementation.
Methods like `clj-http.lite.client/get` are sugar over this `clj-http.lite.client/request` function.
