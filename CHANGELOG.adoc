A release with known breaking changes is marked with:

* [breaking] you probably need to change your code
* [minor breaking] you likely don't need to change your code

// DO NOT EDIT: the "Unreleased" section header is automatically updated by bb publish
// bb publish will fail on any of:
// - unreleased section not found,
// - unreleased section empty
// - optional attribute is not [breaking] or [minor breaking]
//   (adjust these in publish.clj as you see fit)
