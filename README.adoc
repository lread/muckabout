= Testing 123 - GHA triggers

Goal: Always run tests once for pushed commit(s).

This should be the case for:

* push to master on this repo [good]
* push to branch on this repo [good]
* push to fork of this repo
* push to PR of this repo
** from local branch [good]
** from fork

Currently GHA is building twice on push to PR.
Once for PR and once for push.

I'd like to avoid this waste of compute.
Also, it is confusing.

By default the pull_request triggers on the following activities:
- opened
- synchronize
- reopened

What if we remove synchronize? Would that do the trick?

It seems to for local branch PR.
I no longer see the duplicate trigger on the PR checks:
Only 1 for push, no longer any for synchronize.
